# Feature Specification: Unified Development Environment

**Feature Branch**: `002-unified-dev`  
**Created**: 2025-06-23  
**Status**: Completed  

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## Executive Summary

This feature provides developers with a unified command-line interface for running and testing the entire application stack. It consolidates frontend and backend processes into single commands, streamlines logging output, and simplifies the development workflow to reduce context switching and improve developer productivity.

## Problem Statement

Currently, developers must run separate commands and monitor multiple terminal windows to develop and test the application. This fragmented approach leads to missed errors, slower debugging, and increased cognitive load when switching between frontend and backend contexts. A unified development environment will reduce setup time and improve the developer experience.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Stories (must have)
- **US-001**: As a developer, I want to start both frontend and backend with a single command so that I can begin development quickly
  - **Happy Path**: Run `npm run dev` ‚Üí Both frontend and backend start ‚Üí Unified log output shows both services running
  - **Edge Case**: One service fails to start ‚Üí Clear error message indicates which service failed and why
  - **Test**: Execute command and verify both services are accessible and logs are combined

- **US-002**: As a developer, I want to see frontend console logs alongside backend logs so that I can debug cross-stack issues efficiently
  - **Happy Path**: JavaScript console.log in frontend ‚Üí Appears in unified terminal output with clear source identification
  - **Edge Case**: High volume of logs ‚Üí Logs remain readable with proper formatting and timestamps
  - **Test**: Trigger frontend and backend logs simultaneously and verify both appear in chronological order

- **US-003**: As a developer, I want to run all tests with a single command so that I can verify the entire application works correctly
  - **Happy Path**: Run `npm run test` ‚Üí Frontend tests execute ‚Üí Backend tests execute ‚Üí Combined results displayed
  - **Edge Case**: Tests fail in one stack ‚Üí Clear indication of which stack failed with detailed error output
  - **Test**: Introduce failures in both stacks and verify error reporting is clear and actionable

### Secondary User Stories (nice to have)
- **US-004**: As a developer, I want to run frontend tests separately so that I can quickly iterate on UI changes
  - **Journey**: Run `npm run test:player` ‚Üí Only frontend tests execute ‚Üí Fast feedback on UI changes
  - **Test**: Verify only frontend test suite runs and completes faster than full suite

- **US-005**: As a developer, I want to run backend tests separately so that I can quickly verify API changes
  - **Journey**: Run `npm run test:backend` ‚Üí Only backend tests execute ‚Üí Fast feedback on API changes
  - **Test**: Verify only backend test suite runs and completes faster than full suite

### Critical Test Scenarios
- **Error Recovery**: When one service crashes, the other continues running with clear indication of the failure
- **Performance**: Development server startup completes within 10 seconds on standard developer hardware
- **Data Integrity**: Log output from both services is never lost or interleaved incorrectly

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a single `npm run dev` command that starts both frontend and backend services
- **FR-002**: System MUST display unified log output showing messages from both frontend and backend
- **FR-003**: System MUST capture and display JavaScript console output (console.log, console.error, etc.) from the frontend
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear source identification for each log entry (frontend vs backend)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a single `npm run test` command that runs both frontend and backend test suites
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide separate commands for running frontend tests (`npm run test:player`) and backend tests (`npm run test:backend`)
- **FR-007**: System MUST gracefully handle service failures without terminating the entire process
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide color-coded or otherwise visually distinct log output for different sources

### Key Entities
- **Log Entry**: Represents a single log message with timestamp, source (frontend/backend), level (info/warn/error), and content
- **Service Process**: Represents either the frontend or backend service with status (running/stopped/errored)
- **Test Suite**: Represents a collection of tests for either frontend or backend with execution status and results

## Success Criteria

### Functional Validation
- [x] All user stories pass acceptance testing
- [x] All functional requirements work end-to-end
