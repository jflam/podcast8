# Feature Specification: Podcast Player

**Feature Branch**: `001-podcast-player`  
**Created**: 2025-06-23  
**Status**: Draft  

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Executive Summary *(mandatory)*

A web-based podcast player that fetches and displays episodes from the Hanselminutes podcast RSS feed. Users can browse episodes through an attractive card-based interface and play audio content with full media controls, providing an accessible and engaging podcast listening experience.

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Podcast listeners need a simple, intuitive way to access and play Hanselminutes podcast episodes without relying on third-party podcast apps or manually navigating RSS feeds. The current RSS feed format is not user-friendly for direct consumption, requiring a dedicated interface to browse and play episodes effectively.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Stories (must have)
- **US-001**: As a podcast listener, I want to view all available podcast episodes so that I can browse content
  - **Happy Path**: User visits site ‚Üí Episodes load and display as cards ‚Üí User sees episode titles, images, and metadata
  - **Edge Case**: RSS feed unavailable ‚Üí Show cached episodes with offline indicator
  - **Test**: Verify all episodes from RSS feed display with correct title, image, and metadata

- **US-002**: As a podcast listener, I want to click on an episode card to view its details so that I can learn more before listening
  - **Happy Path**: User clicks episode card ‚Üí Details page opens ‚Üí Full description, title, and player controls visible
  - **Edge Case**: Invalid episode data ‚Üí Show error message with return to list option
  - **Test**: Click each type of episode card and verify navigation to correct detail page

- **US-003**: As a podcast listener, I want to play podcast episodes so that I can listen to the content
  - **Happy Path**: User clicks play ‚Üí Audio starts ‚Üí Player shows progress and controls
  - **Edge Case**: Audio file unavailable ‚Üí Show error with retry option
  - **Test**: Play multiple episodes and verify audio playback with working controls

### Secondary User Stories (nice to have)
- **US-004**: As a returning visitor, I want the site to load quickly using cached data so that I don't wait for feed updates
  - **Journey**: Return visit ‚Üí Cached episodes display immediately ‚Üí Background feed refresh
  - **Test**: Verify cached content loads within 2 seconds on return visits

- **US-005**: As a podcast listener, I want to see new episodes highlighted so that I know what's been added
  - **Journey**: Visit site ‚Üí New episodes since last visit marked ‚Üí Easy identification of fresh content
  - **Test**: Add new episodes to feed and verify highlighting on next visit

### Critical Test Scenarios
- **Error Recovery**: When RSS feed fails, display cached content with clear messaging about offline status
- **Performance**: Episode list must load and render within 3 seconds on standard broadband
- **Data Integrity**: Cached episodes must maintain correct metadata and never show corrupted data

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST fetch and parse the Hanselminutes RSS feed from the provided URL (following redirects)
- **FR-002**: System MUST display each podcast episode as a card showing title, image, and publication date
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to click on episode cards to navigate to a detail page
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide audio playback controls (play, pause, seek, volume)
- **FR-005**: System MUST cache RSS feed data for offline access and performance
- **FR-006**: System MUST display episode descriptions and metadata on detail pages
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle RSS feed errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **FR-008**: System MUST update cache with fresh RSS data each time the application is launched

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Episode**: Represents a single podcast episode with title, description, audio URL, image, publication date, and duration
- **Feed**: Represents the RSS feed metadata including podcast title, description, and last updated timestamp
- **Cache**: Represents stored episode and feed data with expiration tracking

### Non-Functional Requirements *(optional - only if performance/scale critical or storing user data)*
- **Performance**: Episode list page loads within 3 seconds on standard broadband connection
- **Performance**: Audio playback starts within 2 seconds of user clicking play
- **Scale**: Supports up to 1000 concurrent users browsing and 100 concurrent audio streams
- **Reliability**: 99% uptime with graceful degradation to cached content when RSS feed unavailable
- **Security**: All external content (images, audio) loaded over HTTPS
- **Constraints**: Must work in modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) without plugins

---

## Integration Points *(optional - only if external systems involved)*

**External Systems**:
- RSS Feed (https://feeds.simplecast.com/gvtxUiIf): Source of all podcast data, may have rate limits or availability issues
- Audio CDN: Hosts actual audio files, requires handling of various audio formats and potential CORS issues

**Events & Notifications**:
- Feed Update: Triggered when new episodes detected in RSS feed
- Playback Events: Track play, pause, completion for potential analytics

---

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Functional Validation
- [ ] All user stories pass acceptance testing
- [ ] All functional requirements work end-to-end
- [ ] External integrations verified in test environment

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Performance: Episode list loads within 3 seconds
- [ ] Load: System handles 100 concurrent audio streams
- [ ] Error handling: All failure scenarios recover gracefully
- [ ] Data integrity: No data loss under normal and edge conditions

### Measurable Outcomes

---

## Technical & Integration Risks *(optional - only if significant risks exist)*

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: RSS feed format changes breaking parser
  - **Mitigation**: Implement flexible parsing with fallbacks for common RSS formats

### Integration Risks
- **Risk**: RSS feed rate limiting or blocking
  - **Mitigation**: Implement respectful caching strategy with appropriate request intervals
  
- **Risk**: Audio CDN CORS policies preventing playback
  - **Mitigation**: Test audio playback early and implement proxy if needed

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: Large RSS feed causing slow initial load
  - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination or progressive loading of episodes
